Note: The for non Linux distributions, you must include bash the cygwin1.dll and other dependant .dlls used in the same directory as lsz. On windows cygwin, the cygwin1.dll used can be found in cycwin64/bin

-> The x86 bin tools directory for windows based downloads should include these files.  The .dll, and bash.exe should be copied from the cygwin tree used to comile lsz.exe and redistribued in binary form in this dir.
